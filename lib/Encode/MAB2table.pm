=head1 NAME

Encode::MAB2table - Table-driven transformation from MAB2 character set to Unicode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a low-level helper module for the C<Encode::MAB2>
module. It converts the raw MAB2 bytes to Unicode equivalents but only
halfway. The result has B<wrong> Unicode semantics. It is recommended
to work with C<Encode::MAB2> which fixes the wrong semantics by
changing the sequences of combining characters and normalizes the
result to proper Unicode Normalization Form C.
